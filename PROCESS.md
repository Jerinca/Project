## Process Book

# day 1
Handed in proposal again, added a feature to get real time stock prices

# day 2
Found API to get real time stock prices but also, historical stock prices. 
Had a Team meeting and shared our ideas.
Figured out you can always make you project bigger.

# day 3
Talked to Jasper in the morning & I had a lot of questions.
Figured out that you can use a good basic bootstrap template to get tabs as I wanted it.
Also; If I wanted to make a website that can create a portfolio for a user and keep track of that portfolio, I would need a database.
Therefor, I made the desicion to make a graph about historical stock prices if the user enters a ticker symbol.

After that I am going to chech what I can do for the portfoliopart.

# day 4
Made a search bar and a grid. Still need to figure out how to implement a click on feature.

# day 5
I can use the users input to search for the right API.

Furthermore the interactive graph with historical stock information is not going to be a problem. The idea now is to create a barchart underneath that is going to show the volatility of a stock per day month and year.

We had a meeting this morning with Kim, and Figured out that I needed to create a concrete 3rd visualisation. The portfolio idea, is going to be a bit complex. Due to a database that is going to be neccesary but also because of the amount of API calls you need to make. Therefor I had to come up with another idea. That is going to be an overvieuw of the Headquarters location of the s&p 500 companies in a map. 

# day 6
I can get my data in a list now

# day 7
The user can enter a ticker symbol, and then a graph pops up with the historical stock prices of the entered stock. When a new stock is entered a new graph comes underneath.

The goal is to update the graph instead of creating a new one underneath. Also I'm trying to make a tooltip so you can hover over the line chart and click on a day so you can see the daily volatility.
