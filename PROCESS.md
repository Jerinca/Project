## Process Book

# day 1
Handed in proposal again, added a feature to get real time stock prices

# day 2
Found API to get real time stock prices but also, historical stock prices. 
Had a Team meeting and shared our ideas.
Figured out you can always make you project bigger.

# day 3
Talked to Jasper in the morning & I had a lot of questions.
Figured out that you can use a good basic bootstrap template to get tabs as I wanted it.
Also; If I wanted to make a website that can create a portfolio for a user and keep track of that portfolio, I would need a database.
Therefor, I made the desicion to make a graph about historical stock prices if the user enters a ticker symbol.

After that I am going to chech what I can do for the portfoliopart.
