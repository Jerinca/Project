# Project Stock history & info 
## Problem statement. 

Investing in stocks can be scary. Because you do not know what your chances are. 
But you can keep track of how risky a stock is. 

To look at the risk of a stock you can have a closer look at the volatility of a stock. 
Also would be handy to see what stock prices did in the past if you want to invest in them. 


## Solution. 
The idea is to create an informative website with stock history on it from any stock from the past 100 days. Added to that you would maybe like to compare the daily volatility from a stock with the monthly and yearly volatility. 

The idea is to visualize a bubble chart that must contain the companies of the S&P500. 

To make sure an investors picks the stock he wants to trade in he should be able to see a detailed and statistic overview of a stock that he is looking for. That could be the sharp ratio. The sharp ratio uses the standard deviation of a stock to calculate the volatility of a stock.

### visual sketch. 

The first page an Investor is entering is going to be the homepage. On that homepage the investor you be able to go to different pages. 

By inserting a stock symbol and see an overview of more complex statistics of the stock. 

There will be an map with an overvieuw of the companiess that are in the S&P500 and how much their weight is in that index.
There should be an information page as well, were you can find what the website is showing you and why.
