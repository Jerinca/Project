# Project Stock Portfolio. 
## Problem statement. 

Investing in stocks can be scary. Because you do not know what your chances are. 
But you can keep track of how risky a stock is. 

You have different types of risks. For example Systematic Risk and Unsystematic risk.
The problem is sometimes you dont have the time to spend time to figure out how risky your stock is. 
Furthermore, it is important to keep track of your stocks. Therefore it would be really handy to have a visualisation of the different characterisctics of a stock.

## Solution. 

To make sure an investors picks the stock he wants to trade in he should be able to see a detailed and statistic overview of a stock that he is looking for. That could be the sharp ratio. The sharp ratio uses the standard deviation of a stock to calculate the volatility of a stock.

### visual sketch. 

The first page an Investor is entering is going to be the homepage. On that homepage the investor you be able to go to different pages. 
By inserting a stock symbol and see an overview of more complex statistics of the stock. 

Also an investor should be able to click on a button to go to the next page to create a portfolio of stocks. As a result they should be able to see how much the portfolio is growing.

There should be an information page as well, were you can find what the website is showing you and why.

### review of similar or related visualizations. 
When you would visit https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/examples, you see a few examples of how a stock is being presented. In my opinion this can be done better. 

### Identify the hardest parts. 
Creating a portfolio. It contains different stocks, with different data. They need to be combined. That can be hard. Furthermore, the mathematics behind this can be a little complex. But once it is done in a constructive way, it can becomen very clear.
